This dataset is an open-source dataset from the paper "Tongue Images Dataset for Diagnosis Detection Applied in Chinese Medicine", which has been iteratively updated to the third version.

This dataset contains 21 disease categories that can be used for target detection in tongue diagnosis. The categories are jiankangshe (Healthy Tongue), botaishe (Tongue with peeling coating), hongshe (Red tongue), zishe (Purple tongue), pangdashe (Chubby tongue), shoushe (Thin tongue), hongdianshe (Red dot tongue), liewenshe (Cracked tongue), chihenshe (Dentate tongue), baitaishe (White coating tongue), huangtaishe (Yellow coating tongue), heitaishe (Black coating tongue), huataishe (Smooth coating tongue), shenquao (renal depression), shenqutu (renal protrusion), gandanao (Hepatobiliary depression), gandantu (Hepatobiliary protrusion), piweiao (spleen and stomach depression), xinfeiao (heart and lung depression), xinfeitu (heart and lung protrusion), corresponding numerical order is 0-19.

Among them, there are 5594 images in the training set, 572 images in the validation set, and 553 images in the test set. Contains three annotation formats: coco/. txt/. xml, which can be used for experiments using relevant object detection algorithms through configuration files. The dataset is now shared through Baidu Cloud.

(1)The dataset address for coco annotation format is: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1H2PYhz3ObAmXUHKu25TuDw
Extraction code: b02g

(2)The dataset address in. txt annotation format is: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ioQgU6rQ0KNqHndPyURd3w
